# **Go Project Example**

This repo contains an example of `golang` module with a simple
web server. Currently it is more of a toy server, but I am planning to
update it to a more decent state.

## **Current TODO**:

+ Multilayer image build with `Docker` (possibly wrap into another workflow)
+ More unit-tests
+ Support for a DB connection for persistent storage
+ Dig a bit deeper into channels, goroutines and asynchronous stuff
